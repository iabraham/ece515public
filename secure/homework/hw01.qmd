## Homework 1 - Due: 09/04

### Problem 1 

Determine conclusively which of the following are fields:

 a. The set of integers.
 b. The set of rational numbers.
 c. The set of polynomials of degree less than 3 with real coefficients.
 d. The set of all $n \times n$ matrices.
 e. The set $\{0,1\}$ with addition being binary "exclusive-or" and multiplication being binary "and". 

### Problem 2 

 a. Define rules of addition and multiplication such that the set consisting
 of three elements $\{a, b, c\}$ forms a field. Be sure to define the zero and
 unit elements. 
 b. Do Exercise 1 from Lecture Note 2 - [Link](/exlecs/lec02.html#exr-integersmodp)

### Problem 3

 a. Let $A$ be the linear operator in the plane denoting 
 counter-clockwise rotation around the origin by some given angle $\theta$.
 Compute the matrix of $A$ relative to the standard basis in $\mathbb{R}^2$. 
 b. Is the set $\{I, A\}$ linearly dependent or independent in
 $\left(\mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}, \mathbb{R}\right)$ with 
$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix} $$
 c. What about the set $\{I, A, A^2\}$?

### Problem 4
Consider the standard double mass-spring-damper system. Derive the equations of
motion and put them in state space form:

$$ \dot{x} = A x + B u $$

where 
$$
x = \begin{bmatrix} p_1 & \dot{p}_1 & p_2 & \dot{p}_2 \end{bmatrix}^{T},
$$

is the state vector.

### Problem 5

Consider the standard RLC circuit, except now allow its characteristics $R, L$
and $C$ to vary with time. Starting with the same non-dynamic physical laws as
in class ($q = CV_c$ for the capacitor charge, $\varphi = LI$ for the inductor flux),
derive a dynamical model of this circuit. It should take the form:

$$ \dot{x} = A(t) x + B(t) u $$

### Problem 6 

 a. Let $S$ be the set of all vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose components sum to zero. Prove that $S$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Determine a basis for $S$ and compute its dimension. 
 b. Provide a basis for the kernel of the linear operator $L$ defined as:

 \begin{align*}
    L: \mathbb{R}^3 &\to \mathbb{R}^2 \\

  \left(x_1, x_2, x_3\right)^{T} &\mapsto \left(x_1 + 2x_2, x_2 - x_3\right)^T
  \end{align*}
