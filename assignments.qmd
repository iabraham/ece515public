## Gradescope course code
Use entry code **TBD** to add the course on Gradescope where you will be
submitting assignments. Best practice is to **use your Illinois e-mail ID** to
make an account.

## Instructions

We prefer you **typeset your homework**. Latex files are provided for each
homework assignment which you can use in conjunction with the [homework
template](/secure/homework/hw-template.tex){target="_blank"}.

::: {.column-margin}
The provided template is a generic template with no content. You should replace
all content in red font with your own. You may use the provied `.tex` file for each homework below.
:::


::: {.column-margin}
The provide `.tex` files are auto-generated using [`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/index.html). It may not be
the cleanest LaTeX source. 
:::

We do this for two reasons:

 - This is a graduate level course, and the majority of you will write
   papers, theses, dissertations, etc. You will need to know Latex. This
   course is as good a time as any to develop the skill. 
 - This is a largely theoretical or proof-based course with computations
   sprinkled once in a while. It makes your TA's life easier if you put in
   the effort to clean up your work/thoughts when you write proofs. 

If you insist on relying on pre-semiconductor era tools, 

 - Make sure your written work is **legible**. If the TA cannot read your work, they
   cannot grade it. They may ask you to resubmit or dock points off.
 - When plotting functions, use a ruler and graph paper. Include a title and
   axes labels on all plots.
 - Do upload high quality PDF scans; most modern smartphones have a document
   scanning functionality.

::: {.column-margin}
Of course you are always welcome to the modern age and free to use MATLAB,
Python, etc.

Regardless of whether you typeset or write solutions by hand, read about how to
submit assignments on Gradescope
[here](https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work){target="_blank"}.
Some pointers:

 * Make sure to use the tools in Gradescope to mark where in your upload the answer to each question can be found.
 * One good practice is to start each question on a new page.
 * For a multi-page answer, associate all relevant pages with the question.
 * Include units where appropriate.
